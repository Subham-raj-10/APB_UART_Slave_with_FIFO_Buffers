# APB_UART_Slave_with_FIFO_Buffers
This project implements a fully functional APB-compliant UART Slave module with parameterized transmit (TX) and receive (RX) FIFOs, baud rate selection, and loopback support. Verified with a self-checking Verilog testbench and waveform analysis for reliable serial communication simulation.
